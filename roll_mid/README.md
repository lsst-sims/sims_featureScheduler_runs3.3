Varying how many rolling seasons and when a constant season is inserted.

roll_mid3.py should be like the baseline, but with constant seasons inserted. (indeed, roll_mid3_const_season_v3.3 where no constant season is inserted does match the baseline)


roll_mid2 : 2 cycles of rolling

roll_mid1 : 3 cycles of rolling

baseline is 4 cycles of rolling.



There is a bug-ish behavior if a constant season isn't inserted in the middle of rolling cycles.
